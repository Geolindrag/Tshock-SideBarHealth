# Tshock-SideBarHealth

**This plugin has some bugs that i did not care to fix,bad code in general, and a NULL exception on player join, as was only used on local worlds with 2-8 players, so be careful if you plan to use it on an actual public server**

A Tshock Plugin that shows everyone's health values on the sidebar in text format

You can customize the color of the health bar via the Config file, Add Keyframes to change colors depending on the HP%, Customize the format to be shown, and add a special format if the player is dead

## Config file params
The config file will appear once you have installed the plugin and ran Tshock once
You can refresh it on the go once you modified by running /refresh in the Tshock console
